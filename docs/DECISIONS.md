# Decisions, source conflicts and reviewer questions

Append-only. A decision is never edited after the fact; it is superseded by a later entry
that names it.

## Deviations from the published plan (revision C)

**D1 — Open-access sources replace Brazis and Blumenfeld.**
Plan step 0.1 said expectations would be transcribed from those two books with page
numbers. Neither was available. Inventing a page number would be the single worst defect a
traceable-accuracy tool can have, so expectations cite the open-access chapters in
`SOURCES.md` by URL, and every knowledge-base row carries `bookRef: 'pending'` for a reviewer
who owns the books to fill in.

**D2 — The crossing offset is 1–3 segments, not 1–2.**
The plan asserted 1–2. That figure came from memory. The two sources actually read (S01, S11)
both say 1 to 3. The knowledge base records `[1, 3]`. Consequence: the engine reports a
band of *indeterminate* pain–temperature status one to two segments wide instead of a single
crisp sensory level, which is the honest representation of the disagreement.

**D3 — Both laminations are contested, not only the spinothalamic one.**
Revision C of the plan says cervical corticospinal lamination is "far less disputed". S06
says the opposite: neuroanatomic studies show a diffuse distribution of arm and leg fibres,
and arm-predominant weakness is now attributed to denser hand representation. Both
laminations are mechanism rows. "Arms weaker than legs in central cord injury" is an
observation row. The published plan must be corrected.

**D4 — Tabes is modelled as a partial dorsal-root lesion; no large/small-fibre split.**
S13 describes decreased (not absent) reflexes and diminished pain alongside proprioceptive
loss. A partial lesion of the whole dorsal root produces all three. A fibre-class split
would be an untested row.

**D5 — Spinocerebellar tracts are deferred.**
Plan step 0.3 listed them. No P0 expectation exercises them, and the mutation rule forbids
a row nothing tests. They return when a case needs them.

**D6 — Light touch is not a separate modality in P0.**
S01, S05 and S15 put tactile sense with the posterior columns; S07 says fine touch is
preserved when the posterior columns are. The `posterior_column` modality therefore means
vibration, proprioception and fine touch together. Crude touch in the anterior spinothalamic
tract is not modelled.

**D7 — The vertebra-to-segment map holds only the row a case exercises.**
P0 needs L1 → conus (S2–Co1), from S14. The cervical and thoracic rules of thumb are
unsourced here and untested, so they are absent until P1 renders both rulers.

**D8 — Fifteen cases, seventeen evaluations.**
The complete-transection cases are each evaluated at two timepoints, because the defect
they exist to catch (A—01, spinal shock) is a difference between timepoints.

**D9 — Expectations assert only what a source supports.**
Where a source is silent, the expectation is silent too, even when the engine will produce
an answer. Silence is recorded in each case's `unasserted` list so a reviewer can see what
was deliberately left open.

## Source conflicts

**C1 — Direction of the contralateral pain level in hemisection.**
S01 says contralateral pain and temperature loss sits "1 to 3 levels above the level of
injury". A lesion cannot remove sensation from segments above it through an ascending
tract: fibres entering above the lesion ascend away from it. S11 describes the same 1–3
figure as an ascent before crossing, which places the contralateral loss *below* the
lesion. S05 and S15 say "below" without a number. **Reading adopted:** loss begins 1–3
segments below the lesion; the S01 wording is treated as an error. Reviewer question R1.

**C2 — Triceps reflex root levels.**
S12 gives C7–C8. The commonly taught C6–C7 was not found in any source read, so it is not
recorded. Single-source row.

**C3 — Brachioradialis reflex root levels.**
S12 gives C5–C6; S19 lists brachioradialis under C6. Recorded as `[C5, C6]` with both
sources; tier T3 because the sources differ in extent.

**C4 — MSD's central cord row.**
Two separate queries both reported that S05 places central cord syndrome in the *thoracic*
cord. Every other source places it in the cervical cord. The raw table text could not be
obtained, so the row is excluded rather than cited either way.

**C5 — Conus syndrome motor signs.**
S09 and S14 describe UMN signs (hyperreflexia) in conus syndrome. A lesion confined to
S2–Co1 produces no lower-limb hyperreflexia in this model, since the reflex arcs and the
corticospinal fibres serving them lie above it. The clinical description plausibly reflects
lesions extending above the conus proper. Case 14 therefore asserts nothing about
lower-limb reflexes. Reviewer question R3.

## Reviewer questions

**R1** — Confirm the reading of C1: in a hemicord lesion, contralateral loss of pain and
temperature begins 1–3 segments *below* the lesion.

**R2** — Is a single-root lesion better modelled as reduced sensation (because of dermatomal
overlap, S21) than as absent sensation? The engine reports `impaired` for an isolated root.

**R3** — Confirm C5: are UMN signs in conus syndrome explained by involvement above S2?

**R4** — The bulbocavernosus reflex is modelled on S2–S4 from the pudendal nerve's origin
(S22). No source read states the reflex's level directly. Please supply one.

**R5** — Limb regions (upper limb C5–T1, lower limb L2–S2) and the saddle (S3–S5) are
modelling conventions with no source read. Please confirm or correct.

**R6** — The Babinski rule treats any corticospinal interruption rostral to L5 as
sufficient. No source read gives the plantar reflex's segments.

**R7** — Descending bladder and sympathetic control is modelled as a lateral-funiculus
compartment that a unilateral lesion does not disable (S01: sphincter function generally
spared in hemisection). Its position in the cord is not stated by any source read.
